Blind SQL Injection — Boolean-Based
Overview

This lab demonstrates a Blind SQL Injection (Boolean-Based) vulnerability where the application does not return database output or errors.
Information is inferred by observing differences in the HTTP response when conditions evaluate to true or false.

Vulnerability Detection

A classic payload such as:

' OR 1=1-- -


does not produce visible errors or messages, but may subtly change the response.

Indicators of a blind SQL injection include:

Changes in page content

Differences in Content-Length

Small visual changes in the response

If adding a single quote (') alters the response behavior, the parameter is likely injectable.

Confirming User Existence
' AND (SELECT 'a'
FROM users
WHERE username='administrator')='a'-- -

Explanation

The subquery checks whether the user exists

If the condition is true, the application response changes

This confirms the presence of the administrator account

Character Enumeration
' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1)
FROM users
WHERE username='administrator')='m'-- -


This technique allows extracting data one character at a time by observing the response behavior.

Password Length Discovery
' AND (SELECT 'a'
FROM users
WHERE username='administrator'
AND LENGTH(password)=20)='a'-- -


If the response is valid, the password length is confirmed.

Conclusion

Using boolean-based inference, sensitive information can be extracted even when the application does not return database output directly.
